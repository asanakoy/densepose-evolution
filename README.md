### DenseposeEvolution Models & Bootstrapping Pipeline

We introduced a pipeline
to transfer DensePose models trained on humans to proximal animal classes (chimpanzees),
which is summarized in Figure 3. The training proceeds in two stages:

First, a *master* model is trained on data from source domain (humans with full
DensePose annotation `S`, `I`, `U` and `V`)
and supporting domain (animals with segmentation annotation only).
Only selected animal classes are chosen from the supporting
domain through *category filters* to guarantee the quality of target domain results.
The training is done in *class-agnostic manner*: all selected categories are mapped
to a single category (human).

Second, a *student* model is trained on data from source and supporting domains,
as well as data from target domain obtained by applying the master model, selecting
high-confidence detections and sampling the results.


Examples of **pretrained master and student models** are available in the [Model Zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/projects/DensePose/doc/DENSEPOSE_IUV.md#ModelZooBootstrap).
